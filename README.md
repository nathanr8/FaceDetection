# FaceDetection

## Motivation
The purpose of this project was to learn. A major motivation behind this project was familiarizing myself with various machine learning concepts I may inquire as part of a MLOps environment. To begin, I used Kaggle in a project for the first time. I found a dataset containing labeled images of faces containing Angry, Sad and Happy people to train my neural network on. I made a baseline model containing over 63 million parameters to start to see how accurate a new, raw model could be. After evaluating where the model was misclassifying images of various types, I implemented data augmentation using Keras Layers to see how much this would improve performance, it did not do much. I then used EfficientNet with feature extraction and fintuneing to reduce the total number of parameters my model had by over 40 million, and further reducing the total number of trainable parameters by over 60 million. Using this new model, I implemented a model visualization aspect for people to see a heatmap representation of what each layer in the model focuses on in an image to determine its classification. I then converted this model to a quantized ONNX format, allowing it to be used in other frameworks and reducing its required storage by over 92%. I then compared the time it took for a prediction across the orginal model, and the onnx quantized version.
